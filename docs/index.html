                <h2>
                    We created a physical music inventory tracking app!
                </h2>
                <!-- Description of the app -->
                <p>
                    [Brief project description here]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project is a mobile application to be deployed on both iOS and 
                    Android platforms. The application’s purpose is to track users’ 
                    physical album purchases and wishlist items. The app allows the user 
                    to differentiate between their vinyl and compact disc (CD) collections 
                    or view their collection as a whole. The user is provided with three 
                    distinct search options in order to find an album they want to add to 
                    their collection. They can search either through text, barcode 
                    scanning, or cover art scanning. Once in their own inventory they 
                    will be able to add additional information about an album if they’d 
                    like. The app has four main pages, accessible through the tab bar at 
                    the bottom of the screen: user’s inventory, wishlist, search page, 
                    and settings. The goal of the app is to help people track what they 
                    already own so they don’t accidentally purchase the same record 
                    twice. It is also to help remember albums they were interested in 
                    and yet haven’t purchased, so they don’t have to mindlessly wander 
                    around record stores.

                <h3>Inventory: Stax of Trax</h3>
                <p>
                    The user’s inventory, deemed “Stax of Trax,” can be categorized by 
                    artist name, by genre, or simply ordered alphabetically by album name. 
                    When browsing through the inventory, the user selects which collection 
                    they want to look through (vinyl, CD, or their whole collection), as 
                    well as how they want their inventory categorized (artist, genre, or 
                    album). For example, the user is able to see a list of all artists 
                    who have created albums that the user owns vinyl copies of. When 
                    selecting a specific artist, the user is able to see all the vinyl 
                    records the user owns by that artist. The user is also able to search 
                    their inventory, using a text bar at the top of the inventory page. 
                    They can search their collection by artist, album name, or song title. 
                    Selecting an album, navigated to by either searching or browsing the 
                    user’s inventory, takes the user to a page that provides more detailed 
                    information about the album. 
                </p>

                <h3>Inventory: Album Details Page</h3>
                <p>
                    At the top of the album details page, the album cover art is clearly 
                    on display. Followed by the album’s name, the artist’s name, the genre a
                    nd the year the album was first released. After the basic album 
                    information is displayed, the app also provides a tracklist with the 
                    song titles and duration of the songs listed in album order. After the 
                    tracklisting, a list of album contributors is displayed showing the names 
                    of the people who have provided something to the album and their role on 
                    the album. For example, cover art design, album producer, or a featured 
                    musician. The user will also be provided with space to add record 
                    pressing data. The pressing section will have various fields where the 
                    user can enter specific information: who the album manufacturer is, when 
                    the album was pressed, how many LPs are in the user’s copy, whether 
                    the LPs are colored, etc. Finally, the album details page ends with a 
                    section for the user to add additional notes about the album. This will 
                    be an open ended text field for the user to write whatever thoughts they 
                    may want to keep.
                </p>

                <h3>wishlist</h3>
                <p>
                    The wishlist will provide a page that will keep track of albums that the 
                    user wants to add to their inventory in the future. If there is an album 
                    within the wishlist, and the user later adds it to their inventory, the 
                    album within the wishlist will automatically get deleted.The wishlist 
                    can be viewed either ordered by artist name or by album name.  Both will 
                    be displayed as lists in order to view more results on one page at a 
                    time. When a user selects an album in their wishlist they are able to 
                    see basic album information, however there will not be sections on 
                    pressing information or notes as the user does not own a specific copy 
                    yet. When on the album details page within the wishlist, there will be 
                    an option to add the album to their inventory on the top right of the 
                    screen. 
                </p>

                <h3>Search Page</h3>
                <p>
                    Via the search page on the app, the user is able to access a database with 
                    hundreds of millions of existing albums spread across millions of artists. 
                    The user has multiple options for searching this immense record database. 
                </p>

                <h4>Search Method 1: Text Input</h4>
                <p>
                    The first search option, searches using a text input bar. The user then 
                    types a search query and the results are filtered by artists, albums, and 
                    songs. These categories are kept in separate horizontally scrollable lists 
                    that hold at most 10 results. If the user typed in their request correctly, 
                    the majority of the time they should be able to find what they’re looking 
                    for within these first 10. If not, there will be a button at the top of 
                    each categorized list that asks for more results. That button takes the 
                    user to a page that has the traditional vertical scroll with icon formatting 
                    and far more results. Whether navigating through artists, songs, or directly 
                    through the album results, the user will eventually end up on an album details 
                    page for a record they are interested in.
                </p>

                <h4>Search Method 2: Barcode Scanning</h4>
                <p>
                    Another way the user is able to search the larger database, is via a barcode 
                    scanner. Once clicking the barcode icon directly next to the text search bar, 
                    the camera on the user’s phone is opened. They are then able to point their 
                    camera at the barcode on a physical record. Once recognized, the database is 
                    searched using that barcode and the user is taken directly to the album details 
                    page for that record. If the scanner could not read the barcode or the number 
                    is not recognized by the database, the application informs the user and they 
                    are prompted to either try again or use a different search method.
                </p>

                <h4>Search Method 3: Cover Art Scanning</h4>
                <p>
                    The final search method available to the user is album cover scanning. Not 
                    every physical record has a universally recognized barcode. There is also the 
                    possibility that not all barcodes are readable or stored in the large database. 
                    Therefore as another easy method of quickly identifying a physical record, 
                    the user will also be able to scan the cover of the album. Directly next to 
                    the barcode icon is a camera icon. When clicked, it also opens the user’s camera. 
                    This time the user will be able to take a picture of the album cover, and the 
                    artwork will be searched in the database. If recognized, this method will also 
                    take a user directly to the album details page for the record. 
                </p>
                
                <h3>Search: Album Details Page</h3>
                <p>
                    The album details page navigated through any of the three search methods will 
                    provide basic information about the record; including the cover art, artist, name 
                    of the album, genre, year, tracklist, and list of contributors. Once the user 
                    confirms that it is the album they were looking for, they can find an “add” button 
                    in the top right corner. Once clicked, they are prompted to decide if they want to 
                    add the record to their inventory or their wishlist. If they want to add it to 
                    their inventory, they also select which format they purchased the album in. After 
                    these decisions are made, they click add again and the album is stored in the 
                    appropriate place. 
                </p>

                <h3>Setting Page</h3>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the settings page. The settings page will allow users to minimally 
                    customize the app. For example, alternating the color scheme of the app between 
                    preset options or choosing to view all results as lists instead of icons. The 
                    settings page will also allow users to sign in and out of their accounts, delete 
                    their accounts, or look at their account information. It will also have the 
                    application credits, listing who the developers were, any contributors to the app, 
                    and the different external applications that support the app.
                </p>
